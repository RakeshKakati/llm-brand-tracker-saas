# ✅ User Data Filtering Fixed - Multi-Tenant Isolation Complete

## 🔍 Problem

Dashboard, History, and Analytics pages were showing **ALL users' data** instead of filtering by the logged-in user's email.

**Impact**: 
- Users could see other users' trackers and mentions
- Privacy breach in multi-tenant SaaS
- Incorrect analytics and statistics

---

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

Added `user_email` filtering to all database queries in:
1. **DashboardPage** - Stats, charts, recent mentions
2. **HistoryPage** - Mention history records
3. **AnalyticsPage** - Analytics calculations

---

## 📋 Files Fixed

### 1. ✅ DashboardPage.tsx

**Before**: Fetched ALL data
```typescript
const { count: trackersCount } = await supabase
  .from("tracked_brands")
  .select("*", { count: "exact", head: true });
```

**After**: Filtered by user
```typescript
// Get current user
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const userEmail = session.user.email;

// Fetch only user's data
const { count: trackersCount } = await supabase
  .from("tracked_brands")
  .select("*", { count: "exact", head: true })
  .eq("user_email", userEmail);  // ✅ Filter by user
```

**Queries Fixed**:
- ✅ Total trackers count
- ✅ Active trackers count
- ✅ Total mentions count
- ✅ Recent mentions (24 hours)
- ✅ Recent mentions list (top 5)
- ✅ Mention trend chart (7 days)

---

### 2. ✅ HistoryPage.tsx

**Before**: Fetched ALL mentions
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("brand_mentions")
  .select("*")
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

**After**: Filtered by user
```typescript
// Get current user
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const userEmail = session.user.email;

// Fetch only user's mentions
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("brand_mentions")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_email", userEmail)  // ✅ Filter by user
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

**Queries Fixed**:
- ✅ Mention history records
- ✅ Auto-refresh data (every 30 seconds)

---

### 3. ✅ AnalyticsPage.tsx

**Before**: Fetched ALL data
```typescript
const { data: mentions } = await supabase
  .from("brand_mentions")
  .select("*");

const { data: trackers } = await supabase
  .from("tracked_brands")
  .select("*");
```

**After**: Filtered by user
```typescript
// Get current user
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const userEmail = session.user.email;

// Fetch only user's data
const { data: mentions } = await supabase
  .from("brand_mentions")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_email", userEmail);  // ✅ Filter by user

const { data: trackers } = await supabase
  .from("tracked_brands")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_email", userEmail);  // ✅ Filter by user
```

**Queries Fixed**:
- ✅ Brand mentions for analytics
- ✅ Tracked brands for analytics
- ✅ All calculated metrics (mention rate, top brands, etc.)

## 📝 Pattern Used (Apply Everywhere)

**Always follow this pattern for user-specific queries**:

```typescript
// 1. Get user session
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

// 2. Validate session
if (!session?.user?.email) {
  console.error("❌ No user session");
  return;
}

// 3. Extract user email
const userEmail = session.user.email;

// 4. Filter queries by user_email
const { data } = await supabase
  .from("table_name")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_email", userEmail);  // ✅ Always filter
```
