# üîß Stripe Customer Portal Setup

## Problem

When clicking "Manage Billing" button, you see this error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "No configuration provided and your test mode default configuration has not been created..."
  }
}
```

This happens because the Stripe Customer Portal needs to be configured in the Stripe Dashboard first.
