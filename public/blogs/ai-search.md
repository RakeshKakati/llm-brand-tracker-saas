## What is AI search?
LLM-powered systems that synthesize multi-source results, cite evidence, and let you refine conversationally. Unlike classic SERP links, AI search delivers an answer first, with sources you can audit.

## Why it matters
- Cuts research time by 50â€“80%
- Source-grounded answers reduce hallucinations
- Works across web, internal docs, and data silos with RAG

## Tool landscape
- Perplexity: fastest citations-first experience, focus mode, collections
- Bing/Copilot: web + Microsoft 365 integration
- Phind: technical research, code-aware
- Brave/You.com: privacy and customizations

## Implementation guide
1. Standardize prompts for common queries (briefs, competitive intel, how-tos)
2. Save and share threads as org knowledge
3. Add connectors (Drive, Confluence, Notion) and configure permissions
4. For private data, add a RAG layer and cache high-value answers

## Evaluation checklist
- Citations quality and coverage
- Latency and cost per answer
- Integrations and access control
- Export/sharing options

## FAQs
- Can I trust answers? Verify citations; add human review for critical tasks.
- Will it replace our wiki? It complements by making knowledge discoverable.
