# Best AI Tools

AI tools evolve fast. This guide highlights what matters, how to choose, and where to start.

> TL;DR: Start with assistants and AI search (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude), then add marketing (Jasper, HubSpot/Klaviyo), analytics (Looker + Gemini, Power BI + Copilot), and a warehouse + AI platform (BigQuery + Vertex or Snowflake Cortex). Pilot against a baseline and keep what moves a KPI.

| Category | Tool | Strengths | Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Search | Perplexity | Fast, cited answers, focus mode | Cost at team scale |

## How to choose (framework)
1. Define the outcome and KPI (ROAS, CPA, LTV, SLA, time saved)
2. Map one workflow end-to-end that impacts that KPI
3. Trial 2–3 candidates on the same workload against a baseline
4. Measure: accuracy, latency, cost per task, adoption
5. Standardize prompts/playbooks; roll out org-wide

## Real-world playbooks
- Marketing: research → briefs → drafts → variants → measurement. Start with Jasper/Surfer and platform automations (Google PMax, Meta Advantage+). See also: [AI for Marketing](/blogs/ai-for-marketing), [Best AI SEO Tools](/blogs/best-ai-seo-tools).
- Analytics: NL insights in BI + notebook assistants (Looker + Gemini, Hex). Validate with SQL and experiments. See: [AI Analytics](/blogs/ai-analytics).
- Data: central warehouse (BigQuery or Snowflake) + AI platform (Vertex/Cortex) to keep governance and cost in check.

## FAQs
- Will AI replace my team? No—augment first, then automate repetitive steps.
- Do I need a data warehouse? Not always; it helps once you scale usage and governance.
- How do I keep brand voice? Maintain guidelines, style prompts, and approval steps.
