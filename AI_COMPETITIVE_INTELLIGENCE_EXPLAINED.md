# 🤖 AI Competitive Intelligence Engine: How It Works

## The Core Concept

**Instead of just telling you "You're ranked #3", it tells you:**
- **WHY** you're #3 (what competitors do better)
- **WHAT** you're missing (content gaps)
- **HOW** to beat them (actionable recommendations)
- **WHEN** you'll win (predicted impact)

---

## Step-by-Step: How It Works

### Step 1: Data Collection
```
Gathers all mentions for:
- Your brand
- All competitors
- Across all queries
- Over time

Example:
- Your brand: "kommi" (100 mentions)
- Competitor A: "Peec.ai" (150 mentions)
- Competitor B: "Profound" (80 mentions)
- Competitor C: "Writesonic" (200 mentions)
```

### Step 2: AI Analysis
```
OpenAI GPT-4 analyzes:
- What competitors say
- What keywords they use
- What value props they highlight
- What pain points they address
- What language resonates

Example Analysis:
"Competitor A wins because:
- Mentions 'free trial' 3x more than you
- Targets 'startups' keyword (you target 'enterprises')
- Highlights '5-minute setup' (you don't mention this)
- Uses 'affordable' language (you use 'enterprise-ready')"
```

### Step 3: Gap Detection
```
Identifies what you're missing:
- Topics competitors cover that you don't
- Keywords they rank for that you ignore
- Angles they take that you miss
- Messaging that works for them

Example Gaps:
"10 content gaps identified:
1. Competitors mention 'API integration' (you don't)
2. Competitors highlight '5-minute setup' (you say 'enterprise-ready')
3. Competitors target 'startups' (you target 'businesses')
4. Competitors use 'free' keyword (you use 'affordable')"
```

### Step 4: Opportunity Scoring
```
Scores queries by opportunity:
- Low competition (no one dominates)
- High intent (buyer keywords)
- Your strengths (you have the answer)

Example Opportunities:
"15 high-opportunity queries:
1. 'CRM for remote teams' (0.3 competition, high intent)
2. 'CRM with email integration' (your strength, low competition)
3. 'Affordable CRM for startups' (you're affordable, they're not)"
```

### Step 5: Actionable Recommendations
```
Generates specific actions:
- Add these keywords (+20% ranking boost)
- Mention this value prop (+15% boost)
- Include this section (+10% boost)
- Create this content (+25% boost)

Example Recommendations:
"To move from #4 to #1:
1. Add 'free trial' mention (3x) → +25% boost
2. Mention '5-minute setup' → +15% boost
3. Include 'API integration' → +10% boost
Total predicted boost: +50% → Position #1"
```

## Real Example: How It Works

### Scenario
You track: "best CRM for startups"
- Your brand: "kommi" (ranked #4)
- Competitor A: "Peec.ai" (ranked #1)
- Competitor B: "Writesonic" (ranked #2)
- Competitor C: "Profound" (ranked #3)

### What the Engine Does

#### 1. Collects All Mentions
```
Gathers all AI responses for "best CRM for startups":
- Your mentions: "kommi is a brand tracking tool..."
- Peec.ai mentions: "Peec.ai offers free trial with 5-minute setup..."
- Writesonic mentions: "Writesonic provides AI content tools..."
- Profound mentions: "Profound is an enterprise solution..."
```

#### 2. AI Analyzes Why Winners Win
```
OpenAI analyzes all mentions and identifies:

"Peec.ai wins because:
- Mentions 'free trial' 3x more (you mention 0x)
- Highlights '5-minute setup' (you don't mention this)
- Uses 'startups' keyword 5x (you use 'businesses' 2x)
- Emphasizes 'affordable' (you emphasize 'enterprise')"
```

#### 3. Detects Your Gaps
```
Identifies what you're missing:

"Content Gaps:
1. Missing 'free trial' mention (winners mention 3x)
2. Missing '5-minute setup' (winners mention 2x)
3. Missing 'startups' keyword (winners use 5x)
4. Missing 'affordable' messaging (winners use 3x)"
```

#### 4. Scores Opportunities
```
Finds where you can win:

"High-Opportunity Queries:
1. 'CRM for remote teams' (you rank #3, low competition)
2. 'Affordable CRM' (you rank #4, high intent)
3. 'CRM with API' (you rank #2, your strength)"
```

#### 5. Generates Recommendations
```
Provides actionable steps:

"To beat Peec.ai:
1. Add 'free trial' to homepage (3 mentions) → +25% boost
2. Add '5-minute setup' to features page → +15% boost
3. Create 'Best CRM for Startups' content → +20% boost
4. Update messaging to target 'startups' → +10% boost

Predicted Impact:
- Current: #4
- After: #1 (75% confidence)
- Time to rank: 2-3 weeks"
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Collection
```typescript
// Collect all mentions for analysis
const allMentions = await getAllMentions({
  brand: 'kommi',
  competitors: ['Peec.ai', 'Writesonic', 'Profound'],
  queries: ['best CRM for startups', 'affordable CRM', ...],
  timeRange: 'last_30_days'
});
```

### 2. AI Analysis
```typescript
// Send to OpenAI for analysis
const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{
    role: 'system',
    content: `You are a competitive intelligence analyst.
    Analyze why certain brands win and what others are missing.
    Identify gaps, opportunities, and recommendations.`
  }, {
    role: 'user',
    content: `Analyze these brand mentions:
    ${JSON.stringify(allMentions)}
    
    Identify:
    1. Why winners win (keywords, messaging, value props)
    2. What losers are missing (content gaps)
    3. Opportunities (queries where no one dominates)
    4. Recommendations (how to improve)`
  }]
});
```

### 3. Gap Detection
```typescript
// Parse AI analysis
const insights = {
  messagingGaps: extractMessagingGaps(analysis),
  contentGaps: extractContentGaps(analysis),
  opportunities: extractOpportunities(analysis),
  recommendations: extractRecommendations(analysis)
};
```

### 4. Impact Prediction
```typescript
// Predict impact of recommendations
const predictedImpact = await predictRankingImpact({
  currentPosition: 4,
  recommendations: insights.recommendations,
  historicalData: await getHistoricalRankings()
});

// Returns:
// {
//   currentPosition: 4,
//   predictedPosition: 1,
//   confidence: 75,
//   timeToRank: '2-3 weeks',
//   boost: 50
// }
```

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Basic Tracking (All Competitors)
**They show:**
- "You're ranked #3"
- "Peec.ai is ranked #1"
- "Here are your mentions"

**kommi shows:**
- "You're ranked #3 because..."
- "Peec.ai wins because they mention 'free trial' 3x more"
- "Here's how to beat them: Add 'free trial' → +25% boost"
- "Predicted impact: Rank #1 in 2-3 weeks"

### vs. Manual Analysis
**Traditional approach:**
- Marketer manually reviews mentions
- Guesses what competitors do better
- Tries different strategies (hit or miss)
- Takes weeks to see results

**kommi approach:**
- AI analyzes all mentions automatically
- Identifies exact gaps and opportunities
- Provides specific recommendations
- Predicts impact before you optimize

---

## The Value

### Before (Basic Tracking)
```
User: "Why am I #3?"
Tool: "Here are your mentions."
User: "But why #3?"
Tool: "I don't know, just tracking."
```

### After (AI Intelligence)
```
User: "Why am I #3?"
Tool: "You're #3 because:
- Competitors mention 'free trial' 3x more
- You target 'enterprises' but queries ask for 'startups'
- You're missing '5-minute setup' messaging

To beat them:
1. Add 'free trial' → +25% boost → Rank #3
2. Add '5-minute setup' → +15% boost → Rank #2
3. Target 'startups' → +20% boost → Rank #1

Predicted impact: #1 in 2-3 weeks (75% confidence)"
```

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: kommi vs. Peec.ai

**Query**: "best brand tracking tool"

**Current State:**
- Peec.ai: Rank #1
- kommi: Rank #4

**Engine Analysis:**

1. **Why Peec.ai Wins:**
```
"Peec.ai wins because:
- Mentions 'multi-platform' 5x (kommi mentions 0x)
- Highlights '6+ LLMs' (kommi only mentions OpenAI)
- Emphasizes 'affordable' (kommi emphasizes 'enterprise')
- Uses 'marketing teams' keyword (kommi uses 'businesses')"
```

2. **kommi's Gaps:**
```
"Content gaps:
1. Missing 'multi-platform' mention (winners mention 5x)
2. Missing platform coverage details (winners highlight this)
3. Wrong messaging: 'enterprise' vs 'affordable'
4. Wrong target: 'businesses' vs 'marketing teams'"
```

3. **Opportunities:**
```
"High-opportunity queries:
1. 'Free brand tracking' (kommi has free tier, Peec.ai doesn't)
2. 'Brand tracking with integrations' (kommi has webhooks, Peec.ai doesn't)
3. 'Brand tracking contact extraction' (kommi has this, Peec.ai doesn't)"
```

4. **Recommendations:**
```
"To beat Peec.ai:
1. Add 'multi-platform coming soon' (honest, builds trust) → +10% boost
2. Highlight 'free tier' (unique advantage) → +20% boost
3. Emphasize 'integrations' (unique feature) → +15% boost
4. Create 'Contact Extraction' content (unique feature) → +25% boost

Predicted impact:
- Current: #4
- After: #1 (70% confidence)
- Time: 3-4 weeks"
```
