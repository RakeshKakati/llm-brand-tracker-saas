kommi, a new AI brand visibility tracking platform, has launched to help marketing agencies and businesses monitor their brand mentions across AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. The platform combines real-time brand tracking with team collaboration features and contact extraction capabilities.

The core problem kommi solves: When potential customers ask AI assistants "best CRM for startups" or "top project management tools," most brands are invisible in AI responses. Meanwhile, their competitors dominate these answers and capture the leads.

kommi tracks brand mentions across major AI platforms in real-time, showing businesses their exact position in AI search results compared to competitors. The platform provides detailed analytics including mention rates, citation sources, and competitor analysis.

For marketing agencies managing multiple clients, kommi offers dedicated team workspaces where agencies can collaborate on client accounts. Team members can share dashboards, manage trackers together, and export reports for client presentations.

A unique feature sets kommi apart: contact extraction from sources that cite competitors. When a competitor appears in an AI response, kommi extracts contact information including names, email addresses, and job titles from the citing sources. This creates new business development opportunities for agencies to identify and pitch prospects in their clients' industries.

"We built kommi because businesses are losing visibility in the age of AI search," said the kommi team. "Agencies need tools that help them track multiple clients while finding new business opportunities. Our contact extraction feature turns competitor tracking into prospect generation."

The platform is designed for ease of use. Users can set up brand tracking in under two minutes by entering their brand name and search queries. kommi continuously monitors AI platforms and sends alerts when brand mentions change or new competitors emerge.

Key features include real-time tracking across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, competitor analysis with detailed comparison metrics, team workspaces for agency collaboration, contact extraction from citation sources, customizable dashboards for each client, and export capabilities for CSV reports.

kommi operates on a freemium model with free forever access for basic tracking. Paid plans offer advanced features including unlimited trackers, team collaboration, priority support, and enhanced analytics.

The platform is currently available at kommi.in and offers a free tier that allows users to track one brand with basic analytics. Marketing agencies can upgrade to team plans for multi-client management and collaboration features.

For businesses and agencies looking to understand their AI visibility and compete effectively in the age of AI-powered search, kommi provides the insights and tools needed to stay ahead of competitors and capture opportunities.
