## Email Body

**Subject: Your brand is invisible in AIâ€”here's how to fix it**

Hi [First Name],

When potential customers ask ChatGPT or Claude "best [your category] for startups," does your brand show up?

**Most startups don't.** They're losing deals to competitors who rank higher in AI responses.

Here's the problem: You can't track what you can't see. Traditional SEO tools don't monitor AI platforms. Meanwhile, your competitors are consistently mentioned in AI answersâ€”and getting those leads.

**kommi fixes this:**

âœ… See exactly how often AI mentions your brand vs competitors  
âœ… Track your position in AI search results in real-time  
âœ… Get alerted when competitors outrank you  
âœ… Export contact info from sources that cite your competitors (so you can pitch them too)

**Start tracking in 2 minutes.** No credit card required.

Your customers are asking AI: "best CRM for startups" (or whatever you sell).

**Are you in the answer?** Your competitors probably are.
