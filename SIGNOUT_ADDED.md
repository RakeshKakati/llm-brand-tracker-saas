## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. User Session Tracking
```typescript
const [userEmail, setUserEmail] = useState<string>("");

useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserInfo();
}, []);

const fetchUserInfo = async () => {
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (session?.user?.email) {
    setUserEmail(session.user.email);
    console.log("👤 Sidebar - User logged in:", session.user.email);
  }
};
```

### 2. Sign Out Handler
```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  // 1. Confirmation dialog
  if (!confirm("Are you sure you want to sign out?")) {
    return;
  }

  // 2. Sign out from Supabase
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
  
  // 3. Clear localStorage
  localStorage.removeItem('session');
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  
  // 4. Redirect to home
  router.push('/');
};
```
