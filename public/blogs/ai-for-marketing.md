# AI for Marketing

Use AI to accelerate research, creative, targeting, and measurement.

> TL;DR: Start with content generation and platform automations (Google PMax, Meta Advantage+). Add AI for briefs→drafts→variants and automated reporting. Measure incrementality, not just correlation.

- Reporting: Triple Whale, Northbeam, Supermetrics, Improvado

## Step-by-step playbook
1. Pick ONE KPI (e.g., CPA, ROAS, LTV)
2. Map a single workflow end-to-end (e.g., ad creative → variants → test → report)
3. Implement AI tools and prompts; templatize briefs and CTAs
4. Run an A/B against your current process for 2–4 weeks
5. Keep what wins; document prompts/playbooks and roll out

## Measurement and guardrails
- Use holdouts/lift tests where possible
- Track latency, cost per asset, and win rate per variant
- Keep brand voice with style guides and approval steps

## FAQs
- Is PMax the best first step? It’s a strong baseline; still test creatives and landing pages.
- How do we keep quality? Review cycles and brand guidelines; use AI for speed.
